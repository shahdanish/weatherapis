This is a Flask-based web application that provides weather information using the AccuWeather API. The application has the following API endpoints:

/weather (POST): This endpoint retrieves weather information for a city. It takes a city name as a form data parameter and returns the current temperature in Celsius, weather description, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed in kilometers per hour for the given city. If the city is not found, it returns a 404 error, and if the weather data cannot be retrieved, it returns a 500 error.

/cities (GET): This endpoint retrieves cities from the AccuWeather API using the autocomplete endpoint. It takes a query parameter for the city search query and returns a list of cities in JSON format with city key, city name, and country key.

/countries (GET): This endpoint retrieves countries from a hypothetical countries API. It returns a list of countries in JSON format with country key, country code, and country name.

/weather_forecast_5days (GET): This endpoint retrieves 5-day weather forecasts for a location using the AccuWeather API. It takes a location key as a URL request parameter and returns weather forecast data for the next 5 days including daily minimum and maximum temperatures, weather descriptions, and precipitation probabilities.

The application uses the Flask web framework, the flasgger library for Swagger documentation, and the requests library for making HTTP requests to external APIs. It also includes error handling for cases where cities or weather data cannot be retrieved.
